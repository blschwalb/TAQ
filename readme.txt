TAQ - The online waiting list system

This system creates an online  waiting list that anyone can add themselves
to and only certain administrators can edit. It is also designed to not
allow anyone to be taken off the waiting list unfairly before their turn
is up.

It was designed to be run on a fairly locked down shared server and thus
requires no special permissions to run. However, it does require Linux,
Apache, sqlite and php including the sqlite extension (installed by default
as of PHP v 5.0).
